# VoithÃ³s

The world's first semi self-hosted Discord bot.
This bot is unique in that it allows server owners to add as many plugins as they want without any cost from the developer. It works by assigning a special token to each server, which the user then self-hosts an executable and links to the server using that token.

## Features

- Easy to use: Once the server owner has set up the bot and linked it to their server, adding plugins is as simple as dropping a file into the designated folder.
- Customizable: Server owners have complete control over which plugins they want to use, allowing them to tailor the bot to their specific needs.
- Cost-effective: Unlike other bots, this bot doesn't require the developer to constantly update and maintain it, making it a cost-effective solution for server owners.

## Requirements
